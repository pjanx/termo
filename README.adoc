termo
=====

'termo' is a library providing an alternative to ncurses' handling of terminal
input.  ncurses does a terrible job at that, mainly wrt. mouse support which was
even completely broken for a few years, making it impossible to drag things
around in applications.  While that one bit has been fixed, it continues to lack
support for rxvt-unicode's 1015 mode and it's generally incapable of relaying
certain key combinations.

Since terminal I/O is really complicated and full of special cases, this project
doesn't aspire to also replace the output part of ncurses, but is rather
complementary to it.  In the end it makes use of its terminfo library.

The API can be considered stable.  This project is in maintenance mode.

Building and Installing
-----------------------
Build dependencies: cmake >= 3.0, pkg-config +
Optional dependencies: Unibilium (alternative for curses), GLib (for the demos)

 $ git clone https://git.janouch.name/p/termo.git
 $ mkdir termo/build
 $ cd termo/build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

To install the library, you can do either the usual:

 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:

 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i termo-*.deb

To see the library in action, you can try running the demos, which are
statically linked against the library, and hence they can be run as they are:

 $ make demos

What's Different From the Original termkey?
-------------------------------------------
The main change is throwing out any UTF-8 dependent code, making the library
capable of handling all unibyte and multibyte encodings supported by iconv on
your system.  The characters are still presented as Unicode in the end, however,
as the other sensible option is wchar_t and that doesn't really work well, see
http://gnu.org/software/libunistring/manual/libunistring.html#The-wchar_005ft-mess

To make the mouse parsing support actually useful, some API has been added to
set the proper modes on request, and unset them appropriately while destroying.
You can have a look at 'demo-draw.c' for an example.

Another change worth mentioning is the usage of CMake instead of the problematic
libtool-based Makefile.  Now you can include this project in your other
CMake-based projects and simply import the target.  No package maintainer action
is needed for you to enjoy the benefits of proper terminal input.

The rest is just me going silly over formatting and various unimportant stuff.
Oh, and I've deleted the manpages.
